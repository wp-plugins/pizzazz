A simple responsive portfolio that's easy for you to manage and has great support.

== Description ==

<p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNg7s1Vj5z8</p>

Pizzazz is a simple WordPress portfolio plugin that helps you to engage your audience by displaying your work in a clean, 1 page, image based, portfolio.  This approach is important because research has shown that having to wait for a new page to load to get additional information worsens your visitors' experience and increases the chances of them leaving your site without contacting you.  Check out some of its features below:

> #### **Free Version Features**

> * 1 page design.  No page loads keeps your audience's attention and browsing your work.
> * Mobile friendly. Your portfolio will detect mobile phones and flatten out to display cleanly, loading less resources and optimizing for those screens. You can preview the mobile view by flipping a switch in "Settings."
> * Video Integration.  Simply add a video link to Vimeo or YouTube to turn a focus image into a video launcher.
> * Share icon functionality integrated.
> * Custom fields.  Call out specific elements of a portfolio item (e.g. "Year", "Type", "Market", etc.).
> * Compact display of unlimited items.
> * Intuitive Interface. Pizzazz uses the same interface as WordPress categories and posts, so it's easy to figure out what goes where.
> * Use HTML elements like lists, images, and links in your item descriptions.
> * Width sensitive.  Depending on the width of your content area, Pizzazz will adjust the display of items to keep things looking clean even when there isn't much room to do so.
> * Search Friendly.  Portfolio content loads on the page using the short code and not via Ajax, so it's indexable by search engines.

* Categories

== Installation ==

Pizzazz Free Documentation (with pictures!) is available here: [How to Install Wordpress Portfolio Plugin](http://giveitpizzazz.com/wp-portfolio-support/documentation/15-free/3-installation)

* 1) Extract the zip file and just drop the contents in the `wp-content/plugins/` directory of your WordPress installation
* 2) Activate the plugin from Plugins page.
* 3) Edit a page that you want your portfolio to appear on and paste `[pizzazz]` into it.
* 4) Add your images to Pizzazz within your Wordpress admin area.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I embed the portolio? =

Edit a post/page that you want your portfolio to appear on and paste `[pizzazz]` into it.

= What are the plugin requirements? =

The plugin requires WordPress 3.5 and higher. Beyond this, your server must have the PHP GD library installed (most servers do.)

= Does Pizzazz resize images? =

No, the plugin will use whatever image you give it at those dimensions for the main slide and will use the thumbnail created by WordPress for the thumbnail image.

=  Does it really only take 5 minutes to set up a portfolio? =

Yes, setting up a portfolio is a snap. However, it will take you longer than that to determine what you should put in your portfolio and come up with your images and copy.  We can help you present it, but we can't tell you what to put in it. :)

= Are there any recommendations for using Pizzazz? =

Yes, we recommend that you make all of your images the exact same dimensions.  Pizzazz will structure the portfolio to accommodate the largest text and image in the portfolio, but things look best when your images and copy are consistent sizes.  Because of this, it's best to upload some sample copy images into the plugin to determine what sizes you want before you begin building your portfolio in earnest. That way, you know approximately what you need at the beginning and don't have to go back to gather content or images if something doesn't look right.

= What HTML elements can I use in my project descriptions? =

You can use whatever elements you normally use in posts and pages: images, list, links and other common HTML tags.

= What browsers is it compatible with? =

Current versions of all major browsers are supported.

= How do I get help? =

You can request support here: (https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/pizzazz).  Please note that this is community support and we help out as we can.  The premium version has ticket based support available for dedicated help.

= Who made Pizzazz? =

Pizzazz is the baby of Blue Bridge Development, a web development firm based out of Portland, Oregon.  We built it because we are interested in helping other creative professionals and freelancers build their business and saw an opportunity to do so by improving web based portfolios.
