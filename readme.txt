5 Minute Setup | Showcase Your Work | Persuade Clients

== Description ==

As a creative professional, your portfolio plays a critical role in persuading potential clients to contact you. You want it to be visually distinct from the other pages on your site. You want to capture your viewers attention. *But creating a distinct portfolio often takes programming skill and days of labor.*

Pizzazz helps you leap over this obstacle. It takes *just a few minutes to set up* and embeds in normal Wordpress content by simply typing in the portfolio shortcode. Your work is displayed cleanly with your comments for each project and snazzy visual effects linking everything together. This **frees you up to focus on what really matters.**

## Features

* Intuitive Interface. Pizzazz uses the same interface as WordPress categories and posts, so it's easy to figure out what goes where.
* Width sensitive.  Depending on the width of your content area, Pizzazz will adjust the display of items to keep things looking clean even when there isn't much room to do so.
* Search Friendly.  Portfolio content loads on the page using the short code and not via Ajax it's indexable by search engines.
* Tablet friendly.  No flash is used, so your portfolio will display normally on viewer's Droid tablets and iPads.
* Coming soon: custom fields, social integration, linked call to action buttons, category layouts, more themes,  and more features.

== Installation ==

* 1) Extract the zip file and just drop the contents in the `wp-content/plugins/` directory of your WordPress installation
* 2) Activate the plugin from Plugins page.
* 3) Edit a page that you want your portfolio to appear on and paste `[pizzazz]` into it.
* 4) Add your images to Pizzazz within your Wordpress admin area.
