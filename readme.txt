As a creative professional, your portfolio plays a critical role in persuading potential clients to contact you. You want it to be visually distinct from the other pages on your site. You want to capture your viewers attention. *But creating a distinct portfolio often takes programming skill and days of labor.*

Pizzazz helps you leap over this obstacle. It takes *just a few minutes to set up* and embeds in posts and pages by simply typing in the portfolio shortcode. Your work is displayed cleanly with your comments for each project and snazzy visual effects linking everything together. This **frees you up to focus on what really matters.**

# Features #

* 1 page design.  No page loads keeps your audience's attention and browsing through your work.
* Responsive. Your portfolio will flatten out to display cleanly on mobile devices and normally on viewer's Droid tablets and iPads.
* Intuitive Interface. Pizzazz uses the same interface as WordPress categories and posts, so it's easy to figure out what goes where.
* Use HTML elements like lists, images, and links in your item descriptions.
* Width sensitive.  Depending on the width of your content area, Pizzazz will adjust the display of items to keep things looking clean even when there isn't much room to do so.
* Search Friendly.  Portfolio content loads on the page using the short code and not via Ajax, so it's indexable by search engines.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

## How do I embed the portolio? ##

Edit a post/page that you want your portfolio to appear on and paste `[pizzazz]` into it.

## What are the plugin requirements? ##

The plugin requires WordPress 3.5 and higher. Beyond this, your server must have the PHP GD library installed (most servers do.)

## Does Pizzazz resize images? ##

No, the plugin will use whatever image you give it at those dimensions for the main slide and will use the thumbnail created by WordPress for the thumbnail image.

##  Does it really only take 5 minutes to set up a portfolio? ##

Yes, setting up a portfolio is a snap. However, it will take you longer than that to determine what you should put in your portfolio and come up with your images and copy.  We can help you present it, but we can't tell you what to put in it. :)

## Are there any recommendations for using Pizzazz? ##

Yes, we recommend that you make all of your images the exact same dimensions.  Pizzazz will structure the portfolio to accommodate the largest text and image in the portfolio, but things look best when your images and copy are consistent sizes.  Because of this, it's best to upload some sample copy images into the plugin to determine what sizes you want before you begin building your portfolio in earnest. That way, you know approximately what you need at the beginning and don't have to go back to gather content or images if something doesn't look right.

## What HTML elements can I use in my project descriptions? ##

You can use whatever elements you normally use in posts and pages: images, list, links and other common HTML tags.

## Who made Pizzazz? ##

Pizzazz is the baby of Blue Bridge Development, a web development firm based out of Portland, Oregon.  We built it because we are interested in helping other creative professionals and freelancers build their business and saw an opportunity to do so by improving web based portfolios.
