    <h2>Are You Leaving Money on the Table?</h2>
    <h3><em>Exclusively</em> for freelancers, subcontractors, and consultants.</h3>
    <p>by John Hooley</p>

    <p>Work bankrolls your goals.  But, most freelancers don't understand the key mechanisms for bringing in regular, <em>profitable</em>, work.  Because of this, it's inconsistent.  Sometimes it's there, sometimes it's not. Sometimes you make money, sometimes you lose your shirt.  Many freelancers just stumble along, with life improving only by degrees, unsure of how to take connect the dots and take big steps forward.  </p> <p>What's sad is that they're blind to the opportunities passing them by.  </p> <p>No one is watching to tell you when a potential heavy-weight client *almost* contacts you. No one can tell you when you could have made 60% more helping someone.  But these missed opportunities routinely occur.  <strong>This is money left on the table- And with no other reason then lack of knowledge about a few critical principles.</strong> This mini course will highlight what's commonly overlooked and help you improve your stream of projects and income.</p>

   <h3>What You'll Learn:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The *1 thing* I would tell myself if I could travel back in time to Day 1.</li>
        <li>Who your arch-nemesis is and how they're costing YOU sales right now.</li>
        <li>How to <em>manufacture time and money</em> by building your own sales machine.</li>
        <li>What noobs overlook and pro's build their businesses on.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why Should You Listen to Me?</h3>

        I'm a veteran consultant that started by selling a humble $500 website to an indie band and built to completing projects for corporations and universities.  In the nearly 7 years I've been in business, I've made every mistake in the book.  <strong>What I've learned in the process has enabled me to sale a steady stream of <em>good</em> projects</strong> while freeing me up to pursue my goals.  I paid off my debts...  I travelled the world...  I spent a year running my business from Japan...  I launched several products.  YOUR goals may be different, but the lessons I've learned about selling your services will help you achieve them just the same.</p>
