    <li>Log In, or create an account if you don't have one (see image below.)</li>
    <li>Describe the bug, your theme, your version of WP, and a link to the affected page if you feel comfortable using one.  <em>More information is better!</em></li>
</ol>
    <h3>What can you expect?</h3>

    <p>We want to build the best possible plugin for portfolios and will do our best to fix whatever bug is occurring as soon as possible.  Depending <br />
        upon the time, day, and bug, this can occur within 24 hours or up to a week. <strong>We only respond to bug reports, Mon - Fri 9:00 - 5:00 PDT.</strong></p>
